# GTK Postgres admin tool

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jamwaffles/postgres-admin-tool.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jamwaffles/postgres-admin-tool)

This is a learning project for getting to grips with Rust and [gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org). Its end goal is to produce an open source, cross platform, polished, Postgres admin tool in a similar vein to the wonderful [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) for Mac.

## Getting started (Linux)

* `apt install libgtk-3-dev`
* `cargo run -p gtk-gui`

It's also worth installing `glade` so you can edit the UI definition files.
